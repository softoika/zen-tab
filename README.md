# Zen Tab
![CI](https://github.com/softoika/zen-tab/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

An extension that brings order to your browser tabs inspired by [LRU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)).

- Brings a lifetime to the tab.
- Closes from the least recently activated tabs if there are many tabs.
- Provides views and options that give you flexible tab controls.

:construction: This extension is **in development**, so not all features have been implemented yet.
